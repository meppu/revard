## Introduction

Revard empowers you to effortlessly expose and monitor your Revolt activities.

An instance is currently running at `revard.meppu.boo`. Before using it, you must join [this server](https://revard.meppu.boo/).

## REST API

### Retrieving user information

`GET /api/users/:id`

> Give it a try: https://revard.meppu.boo/api/users/01F6YN5JWMHJFKPDZVYB6434HX

Example response:

```json
{
  "_id": "01H30ENXEN04AJFV7PBF8G8BH3",
  "avatar": {
    "_id": "3BwmoTaiAoIBunlZxpVyi4s6TOpmS-BG8YDB0ItXjt",
    "content_type": "image/png",
    "filename": "FwMNRM3WYBQ5w4j.png",
    "metadata": {
      "height": 400,
      "type": "Image",
      "width": 427
    },
    "size": 81008,
    "tag": "avatars"
  },
  "badges": 0,
  "bot": {
    "owner": "01F6YN5JWMHJFKPDZVYB6434HX"
  },
  "discriminator": "2007",
  "online": true,
  "username": "Glowie"
}
```

### Avatar Endpoint

`GET /api/users/:id/avatar`

Returns the avatar image of the specified user. (It actually redirects ðŸ¤“)

### Background Endpoint

`GET /api/users/:id/background`

Returns the background image of the specified user. (It actually redirects ðŸ¤“)

## WebSocket

> Check out [this file](https://github.com/meppu/website/blob/main/js/index.js) for an example of WebSocket usage.

Revard's WebSocket functionality is designed to be simpler than that of Lanyard.

You can establish a WebSocket connection by using the `/gateway` endpoint. Revard uses JSON for sending and receiving data.

After connecting, you need to send a ping every 30 seconds. You can accomplish this by sending a `ping` frame or by simply sending the following data:

```json
{ "event": "ping" }
```

To subscribe to one or more users, make use of the `subscribe` event:

```json
{
  "event": "subscribe",
  "ids": ["01H30ENXEN04AJFV7PBF8G8BH3", "01F6YN5JWMHJFKPDZVYB6434HX"]
}
```

By doing so, you will receive timely updates for the specified users within the `ids` array. If you wish to monitor the entire server, simply set it to an empty array. Conversely, if you do not want to monitor any users, set it to null.

To update subscribers, resend the same data with the updated `ids` value.

## Self-hosting

If you prefer not to join our server or want to make it specific to your own server, you can host Revard yourself.

### Environment variables

Before running the bot, you must set the following environment variables:

- `BOT_TOKEN`: Your bot's token. Please note that self-bots are not supported at the moment.
- `REVOLT_SERVER_ID`: The server ID to watch. To avoid conflicts, ensure that your bot is only in one server.
- `REVOLT_SERVER_LINK`: The URL for Revolt server redirection.
- `MONGO_URL`: The URL for MongoDB (must support SSL).
- `PORT`: The port to listen on. If not given, it falls back to 8000.

Additionally, if you are using this bot for another Revolt host, you need to set these special environment variables:

- `REVOLT_WEBSOCKET`: Revolt WebSocket URL. The default is "wss://ws.revolt.chat".
- `REVOLT_API`: Revolt API URL. The default is "https://api.revolt.chat".
- `AUTUMN_URL`: Autumn (Revolt CDN) URL. The default is "https://autumn.revolt.chat".

### Docker

You can use Docker to host your own bot. For example:

```bash
$ docker run --env-file=.env ghcr.io/meppu/revard:latest start
```
